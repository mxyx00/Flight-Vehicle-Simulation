AME 261: Basic Flight Mechanics Final Project 

A multi-purpose script which enables the user to simulate the following for their aircraft: 
- Flight Envelope including:
    - Maximum and Minimum Velocities
    - Velocities of fastest climb
    - Velocities of steepest climb
    - Velocities of most economical climb
- Thrust/Drag vs. Velocity Curve
- Rate of Climb vs. Velocity Curve
- Takeoff & Liftoff Distances vs. Throttle Percentage Curve
- Landing Distance required
And more!
